### Hello!

I'm Mark and I've done a lot of things in my time - sometimes a Cloud Solution Architect, sometimes a Cloud Modernisation Consultant, sometimes a DevOps Engineer, sometimes a trainer, sometimes a leader, sometimes working in the community (Northern Ireland Developer Conference founder, Microsoft MVP alumnus) but always a developer.
