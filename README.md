### Hello!

I'm Mark and I'm sort of a developer but also sort of a Cloud Solution Architect, sort of a Cloud Modernisation Consultant, sort of a DevOps Engineer, sort of a trainer and sort of a community person (Microsoft MVP).

But if you're here you're probably after the dev stuff, in which case I do .NET (C# and F#), JS/TS (mostly React) and a bit of Python.
