### Who am I?

Honestly I'm not sure myself ;) I've not had a job title for about 20 years, but think a bit of Cloud Modernisation Consultant, a bit of Cloud Solution Architect, and also a highly experienced full-stack developer with a healthy dose of DevOps who can actually build it all, plus a speaker and trainer.

#### Some things I do (in no particular order)

* Azure consultancy - Helping teams get the most out of the new application architectures offered by Azure
* .NET development - Expert since inception. Core team emeritus on DNN, the largest .NET open source project at the time
* Web - Mostly SPAs with React
* iOS, Android and Windows apps - Xamarin and UWP
* Conference organiser, international speaker and trainer (notably delivering the official "Modernising Web Applications and Data", "Developing Cloud Native Applications" and "Developers Guide to AI" training days run by Microsoft)

#### My background

At heart I'm as a full stack software developer (focus on Microsoft tech) with over 30 years of commercial experience. Current weapons of choice are:

* Server: Azure Functions, .NET Core (C#/F#), Node.js
* Data: Cosmos DB, Azure SQL, Azure storage
* Client: Xamarin, React
* DevOps: Azure DevOps

I started programming with BASIC on an ICL 1900 series mainframe in 1976 or thereabouts and was first paid for my efforts in the 1980s. Since then I've written stuff in Forth, Pascal, Modula 2, COBOL, Fortran, PL/M, Java, Javascript, SQL, C++, PHP, VB, C#, F#, four flavours of assembly language and probably a couple of other languages that have slipped my mind.

During that time I've worked in just about every corner of development - mainframes to mobiles, assembly language to functional programming, Access to NoSQL, desktop to cloud, device drivers to websites. And I'm still learning.

I always try to keep ahead of the game, so my first commercial website was live when NCSA Mosaic was the browser of choice, I worked with early betas of .NET, and now I'm designing and building serverless cloud solutions.

My superpower is learning so quickly you don't realise I didn't already know it.
